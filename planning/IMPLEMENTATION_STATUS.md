## 🔄 Why Features Were Static → Now Dynamic

### Dashboard Statistics
**Before:** Hardcoded values
```tsx
<div className="text-2xl font-bold">3</div>  // Static resume count
<div className="text-2xl font-bold">12</div> // Static application count
```

**After:** Real-time from API
```tsx
const { resumes } = useResumeStore();
const { stats } = useApplicationStore();
<div className="text-2xl font-bold">{resumes.length}</div> // Dynamic
<div className="text-2xl font-bold">{stats?.total || 0}</div> // Dynamic
```

**Why Was It Static?**
- No API endpoints implemented
- No database models
- No state management connected to API
- Components had no useEffect hooks

**Solution:**
1. Created database models for all entities
2. Built API endpoints for data retrieval
3. Connected Zustand stores to API calls
4. Added useEffect hooks to fetch data on mount

---

### Resume Management
**Before:** Only UI structure, no actual upload/storage
**After:** 
- Upload endpoint that stores files
- Database persistence
- AI analysis simulation
- Real resume list from database

**Why Was It Static?**
- No file upload handler
- No database schema
- No CRUD operations
- No image/file serving

---

### Application Tracking
**Before:** Empty page with hardcoded modal reference
**After:**
- Full CRUD for applications
- Status workflow management
- Statistics calculation
- Timeline tracking (ready)

**Why Was It Static?**
- No API endpoints
- No database storage
- No form handling
- No validation

---

### Job Search
**Before:** Empty page
**After:**
- Full job listing API
- Search functionality
- Job matching (placeholder)
- Real database records

**Why Was It Static?**
- No job data model
- No search implementation
- No matching algorithm
- Pages were placeholder components

---

### Interviews
**Before:** Empty folder
**After:**
- Fully functional interview scheduling
- Status tracking
- Interview type management
- Linked to applications

**Why Was It Static?**
- No models or endpoints
- No scheduling system
- No data persistence
- Missing entire feature
